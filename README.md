# 🚗 Car Price Predictor

## 📌 Overview
I am a beginner and a passionate Machine Learning enthusiast, eager to explore and build ML models. This project is my first step in implementing regression techniques for real-world applications.
Car Price Predictor is a machine learning project that estimates the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, year, fuel type and kilometers driven. This project helps buyers and sellers get a fair market price prediction, making informed decisions easier.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy 📊
- Scikit-Learn 🤖
- Matplotlib, Seaborn 📉
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Feature selection and engineering  
✅ Machine learning model training  
✅ Model evaluation and accuracy analysis  
✅ Interactive price prediction 

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple attributes like:
- Brand
- Model
- Year
- Fuel Type
- Kilometers Driven
- Price (Target Variable)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vennelavarshini18/Car_Price_Predictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Car_Price_Predictor
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
